# Classification 
## Combinational Logic
- *No memory* unit
- Expressed by Boolean func.
- Output depends on only the present input
## Sequenctial Logic
- Storage elements + logic gate  
**Note:** Squential Logic is superset of Combinational


### Combinational Logic
- n input bits -> 2^n binary output
- m output variable produced
    * For each possible input there is only one possible output value exist  

**Exmples:** adders, subtractors, comparators, decoders, encoders and multiplexers


#### Analysis of Combinational Logic
1. Verifying the circuit is combinatinal:
    * no memory
    * no feed back path
        + no right to left connection exist
2. Obtain a Boolean function
3. Interpret ht operation of the circuit

#### Desing of Comb. Log.
- Start with verbal spec.
- Boolean func. or truth table
- Logic circuit

#### Excess-3 Representation
- It's self complementing system.
#### Excess-3 Substraction 
1. Convert nums to excess 3 code
2.
