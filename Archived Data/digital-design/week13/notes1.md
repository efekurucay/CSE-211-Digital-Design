### Binary Multiplier
- For  *J* multiplier and *K* multiplicant bit we need: 
    * (JxK) AND gates
    * (J - 1) K-bit adders to produce product of (J + K) bits.

- Example: to product B3B2B1B0 by A2A1A0
    * K = 4 and J = 3, so 12 AND gates needed.
    * (J - 1)2 (K)4 bit adders is enough.

### Magnitude Comparator
- It determines relative magnitudes: 
    * A > B
    * A = B
    * A < B
