### Converting Among Octal, Hexadecimal and Binary

#### Octal and hexadecimal to Binary
- Restate the binary as tree for octal, four for hex digit from right to left  
- Convert tree bit to octal
- Example: 
    * 1011 -> 1 | 111 -> 1 | 7 so 17 in octal
    * 1011 -> 1111    ->     F so  F in octal
     

#### Binary to Octal and hexadecimal 
- Do vice versa 
    1. Convert each ocatal or hex digit to binary separately.
    2. Put them together
