### Binary Adder and Substracter
- Adders
    * Half adders: 
    * Full adders: 
- Full adder can be constructed with using half adders(*hierrarchical desing*). 
- For 4 bit adder,  without hierrarchical  design one should have to find the function which has truth table with 512 entries.

#### Carry Propogation
- It is disadvantage of hierrarchical desing 
- Each half adder must wait carry in which produced by right side of the half adder. 
- Carry Lookahead Generator is used to generate carry of operation without needing outputs of each half adders.
