### Digital computers
- Computers are synchronous systems

### Signals
- Informations are physical quantities
- Digital systems use quantities as discere values
- 5V is general input voltage
- input -> 3.0v-5.0v -> high <- output <- 4.0v-5.0v
- input -> 0.0v-2.0v -> low  <- output <- 0.0v-1.0v
- Signal reprented(0 and 1) in computer units
    * Cpu -> Voltage
    * Disk -> Magnetic Field
    * CD -> Surface pits
    * DRAM -> Charge
