### Binary to Gray Code
#### Mirror Technique

**Note:** HDL is not a software, it is directly related with hardware.
### Binary Operation

#### Binary Addition
  - 111101 + 10111 = 1010100 

#### Binary Subtraction
  - Barrow concept is still valid
  - '10'(2 in decimal) in binary is barrowed when it needed.

#### Binary Multiplication 
  - Same as decimal multiplication algorithm.

### 1's and 2's Complement
- It is used for simplify substraction operation.
  * Barrowing operation is higly costly thats why complements are used for 

#### 1's complement(diminished)
  - Invert the bits
    0 -> 1
    1 -> 0
  - 11001 -> 00110

#### 2's complement(diminished)
